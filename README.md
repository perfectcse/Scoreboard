# Scoreboard
Introduction:
In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to create a simple score counter for two teams using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is perfect for beginners who want to gain a better understanding of how to manipulate HTML elements and update their content dynamically. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a working score counter that you can integrate into your own projects.

*Things You Will Learn:
Initializing variables to store scores for two teams (Team A and Team B).
Getting references to HTML elements to display the scores.
Creating functions to increment and decrement scores for each team.
Implementing a reset function to bring both scores back to zero.
Understanding the structure and flow of a basic web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*

*Project Folder Structure:
Now before we move on to actual coding we create a project folder structure. We name the project folder – ”Scoreboard”. Within this folder, we have 3 files. These files are:

index.html
style.css
script.js
